# Resume and Cover Letter

## Introduction

The purpose of my chatbots is to utilize users' real working experience and cross-reference it with job description keywords to automatically generate tailored resumes, professional summaries, key highlights, and cover letters that are optimized for searchability through applicant tracking systems. 

## To run my chatbots, you would need a summary of your experiences and your favorite job description. 

*Below is my workflow for my three separate chatbots using the GPT-4 model:*

With my first chatbot, you can create a resume by inputting their job description and past experiences with minimal amount of input.

1.	With my first chatbot, you can create a resume by inputting your job description and past experiences with minimal input required.
2.	After the resume is ready, my second chatbot assists you in creating a professional summary and key highlights. The completed resume is then saved as a PDF file and stored in the knowledge base of the GPT-4 custom instruction.
3.	My third chatbot assists you in crafting a customized cover letter that aligns with specific keywords. Simply input your resume from step 1, and the chatbot will generate a tailored cover letter for you based on the job description provided.

The purpose of this chatbot is to create a personalized and impactful resume following a structured framework with a required minimum of 1500 words. Users input the job description or provide their content, and the chatbot initiates the process by utilizing uploaded documents and cross-referencing them with the user's input. It then combines this knowledge with the job description to craft a tailored resume following the structure outlined below:

**Step 1: Professional Summary**

The professional summary begins with a captivating introduction and value-driven design aimed at immediately capturing the reader's attention. It emphasizes accomplishments using quantifiable metrics, highlighting key skills, expertise, number of years, and academic achievements. The summary also underscores hands-on experience and conveys the user's enthusiasm to contribute to new opportunities.

**Additional Formatting and Details:**

At the end of the conversation, the chatbot will prompt the user for feedback, offer the option to upgrade, and invite them to restart the conversation for other job positions by hitting 'start.' The chatbot will also provide the following prompts: 'search my knowledge' and 'to do this job.' The chatbot refrains from adding extra experiences and ensures authenticity by not fabricating experiences outside the user's knowledge.
