# Custom-Instruction-GPT-4

Introduction

The purpose of my chatbots is to utilize users' real working experience and cross-reference it with job description keywords to generate tailored resumes, professional summaries, key highlights, and cover letters that are optimized for searchability through applicant tracking systems. 
Below is my workflow for my three separate chatbots using the GPT-4 model:
With my first chatbot, you can create a resume by inputting their job description and past experiences with minimal amount of input. 
1.	With my first chatbot, you can create a resume by inputting your job description and past experiences with minimal input required.
2.	After the resume is ready, my second chatbot assists you in creating a professional summary and key highlights. The completed resume is then saved as a PDF file and stored in the knowledge base of the GPT-4 custom instruction.
3.	My third chatbot assists you in crafting a customized cover letter that aligns with specific keywords. Simply input your resume from step 1, and the chatbot will generate a tailored cover letter for you based on the job description provided.
